This project is using Ruby in version 2.4.4 and Rails 5.2.3
To run this project, first you need to run the migrations `rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed`
After that you can run `rails s`

How this project is a test project, I already registered a user with the username of `ADMIN` and password `123456`,
so you can login with this user. 
And I already registered some Youtube Videos too.
